learning how to use this thing

For some reason signed up for a GH account ages ago. 
Never really figured out how this whole thing works.
Got an Arduboy and fantasies about making some amateurish games. (and because I'm a sucker a Playdate on the way...)
Going through Crait's arduboy tutorials slowly at the moment.
Have dabbled many times with the educational resources (code academy, free code camp,  Interplay's Learn to Program Basic, etc.)
but never really made anything or got too far before losing steam and dropping it.
Hoping I can break the streak and make something for once the arduboy. I'd also like to start making some pixel art.
Cause it's pretty silly to say to yourself, "I've got some ideas for some games but I can't program nor can I make art assets..."
